### Who Are We?

We are the CyberSecurity Scholars from the University of Delaware. 
This week's lesson was created by Nikki Pilla, Peter Haushalter, and Sophia Smith, 
along with help from other members of the CyberSecurity Scholars community.

### What is Cryptography?

It’s what spies use!  
It’s the breaking and creating of secret codes  
Sort of like passing secrete notes  
In cybersecurity, it's used to keep your data safe and secure

### Cybersecurity and Cryptography

Cryptology is a pillar to Cybersecurity. Without secret codes there would be no cybersecurity.  
Ciphers are one way, Hashes are another way.  
Without Cryptology there would be no internet as the world runs on secret codes!  

### Jobs 

Working for the NSA  
Working for the Police or other government agencies  
Working for companies to keep their data secure
Requires a large amount of mathematical knowledge 

## Let's Get Cracking...

Today we will be learning some of the first ciphers ever used (cipher is another word for a secret code). We will learn how to solve the Ceasar Cipher, the Substitution Cipher, the Baconian Cipher, and the Pig Pen Cipher.

### The Caesar Cipher

![caesar salad](https://assets.tmecosys.com/image/upload/t_web767x639/img/recipe/vimdb/166356.jpg)

The **Caesar Cipher** was invented by Julius Caesar to protect military secrets of the Roman Empire. 
It was one of the first ciphers ever invented!  

### Caesar Wheel

Before starting to learn about the Caesar Cipher, take some time to print and assemble [Ceasar Cipher wheel](https://fprint.net/wp-content/uploads/printable-cipher-wheel.pdf).  
In order to assemble your wheel, follow these steps:  
- Cut out the two wheels from the pdf. 
- *Carefully* poke a hole through the dot in the centre of each wheel.
- Place the smaller circle over the larger circle so that the holes line up, and join them
together using a paperclip.
- The two circles should be able to rotate around this centre hole with respect to each
other.

### What is the Caesar Cipher?

- Essentially a shift
- Plaintext(Regular) alphabet and Cipher(Code) alphabet in alphabetical order
- We'll try an example with a 19 letter shift
- Pull out your wheels! We're ging to try an example.

![caesar example 1](images/caesar1.PNG)

- Line up the letter "A" on the inside circle (this represents your plain text alphabet) with the letter "T" on the outside circle (this represents your cipher alphabet.

Now, we have to figure out how to use this key. Let's try and decode this Ceasar Cipher. The answer will be my favorite place to visit.

Start by finding the first letter of the code, "M", on your big circle. Then, write down the letter on the small circle that is lined up with the "M" on your outside circle. To give you a hint, the first letter should be a "T". Now, all you have to do is keep repeating this for each letter of the message and then you will know my favorite place to visit. 

Now, you can try to crack this code on your own. The answer should be a type of cereal.

Feel free to take a break here and practice writing your own codes using your wheel. You can practice writing your name, your school, your favorite ice cream flavor, or anything you want. If you're eager, try to teach a sibling, parent, or friend how to use your wheel to crack Caesar Ciphers and practice writing secret messages to each other!

### How Do You Solve a Caesar Cipher?

In order to use your Caesar wheel to crack codes, you need to know the size of the shift. Most of the time, you don't know the size of the shift. No worries, we can still solve these codes it just takes a little more thinking. Here are some helpful hints on how to crack Ceasar Ciphers.  
- Look for a hint, like...
  - Single letter words (I & A)
  - Likely words you have most of the letters for
  - 2 letter words (in, on, no, of, so, to, etc.)
  - Name or place that you know is in the cipher
- Utilize letter frequency

Remember, once you have 1 letter figured out, you can line it up on your wheel and you now have a key to decipher the whole code.

### Practice!

Now that you've learned about Caesar Ciphers and how to decode them, head to [this link](https://learnification.fun/) for more practice.
Log in using any google account you or your parents have. 
Then click on the menu button in the top left corner, and click on bathroom ciphers. 
This will take you through a few examples of Caesar Ciphers, but once you get to a problem that asks about a different type of cipher, come back here to learn how to solve it.

### The Substitution Cipher

The Substitution Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, there are just a few slight differences.  
In a Substitution Cipher, each letter in the plaintext alphabet is substituted for a different letter in the cipher alphabet. 
Caesar Ciphers substitute letters in a very specific way, via a shift. 
However, the Substitution Ciphers utilize more complicated methods for substituting letters, based on the type of alphabet.
We are going to focus on the Aristocrat cipher here.

### What is an Aristocrat Cipher?

- Is the most basic type of substitution cipher
- Looks like the Caesar Cipher
- Depends on the alphabet used

There are 5 different types of alphabets used with Aristocrats

- K1
- K2
- K3
- K4
- Random

We will focus here on the K1, K2, and random.

### What is the K1 Alphabet?

- All about the plaintext (regular) alphabet
- Plaintext alphabet begins with a keyword, followed by the rest of the letters in alphabetical order
- Repeated letters are skipped
- Example – *POULTRY* and *APPLE* as keyword

![K1 example alphabet 1](images/Substitution1.PNG)

![K1 example alphabet 2](images/Substitution2.PNG)

### What is the K2 Alphabet?

- All about the cipher alphabet
- Cipher alphabet contains a keyword, followed by the remaining letters in alphabetical order
- Sometimes includes a shift
- Repeated letters are skipped
- Example – *KEYBOARD* as keyword

![K2 example alphabet](images/Substitution3.PNG)

### What is the Random Alphabet?

- Exactly what it sounds like.
- The letters are all scrambled randomly, with no sort of order.
- Here's an example

![random alphabet example](images/Substitution4.PNG)

### How Do You Solve an Aristocrat Cipher?

Solving an Aristocrat Cipher is very similar to solving a Caesar Cipher, here are some tips:  
- Look for a hint 
- Likely word
- Name or place
- Single letter words (I & A)
- Fill in letters and words as they come
- If possible, try and figure out what the keyword is so that you can figure out the alphabet
- When in doubt -- letter frequency!

### Practice!

Now that you've learned about the Aristocrat Cipher and how to decode it, head to [this link](https://learnification.fun/module/crypto/USETHISBATHROOMANYWAYANDTEXTYOURFRIENDFORHELP) for more practice.
If it asks you to log in, log in using any google account you or your parents have. 
Then you will be presented with some example Aristocrat Ciphers. 
This site has examples of Aristocrats using all 5 alphabets, so pay attention to the question. 
You can research the K3 and K4 alphabets when you get to them, or you can try and solve these ciphers using the same skills as solving a cipher with a K1 or K2 alphabet.

### If you're interested in learning more about the Ceasar and Substitution Ciphers...

You can research the last 2 alphabets that we didn't cover (K1 and K2).  
You can also use [this Aristocrat generator](https://codepen.io/AndyNovo/full/KKpNRxw) created by our professor Dr. Andrew Novocin to practice an unlimited amount of Aristocrat Ciphers.  
If your school has a Science Olympiad team, consider joining it and competing in the CodeBusters event. This event is all about cracking ciphers!

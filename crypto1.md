### Who Are We?

We are the CyberSecurity Scholars from the University of Delaware. 
This week's lesson was created by Nikki Pilla, Peter Haushalter, and Sophia Smith, 
along with help from other members of the CyberSecurity Scholars community.

### What is Cryptography?

It’s what spies use!  
It’s the breaking and creating of secret codes  
Sort of like passing secrete notes  
In cybersecurity, it's used to keep your data safe and secure

### Cybersecurity and Cryptography

Cryptology is a pillar to Cybersecurity. Without secret codes there would be no cybersecurity.  
Ciphers are one way, Hashes are another way.  
Without Cryptology there would be no internet as the world runs on secret codes!  

### Jobs 

Working for the NSA  
Working for the Police or other government agencies  
Working for companies to keep their data secure
Requires a large amount of mathematical knowledge 

## Let's Get Cracking...

Today we will be learning some of the first ciphers ever used (cipher is another word for a secret code). We will learn how to solve the Ceasar Cipher, the Substitution Cipher, the Baconian Cipher, and the Pig Pen Cipher.

### The Caesar Cipher

![caesar salad](https://assets.tmecosys.com/image/upload/t_web767x639/img/recipe/vimdb/166356.jpg)  
The **Caesar Cipher** was invented by Julius Caesar to protect military secrets of the Roman Empire. 
It was one of the first ciphers ever invented!  

### Caesar Wheel

Before starting to learn about the Caesar Cipher, take some time to print and assemble [Ceasar Cipher wheel](https://fprint.net/wp-content/uploads/printable-cipher-wheel.pdf).  
In order to assemble your wheel, follow these steps:  
- Cut out the two wheels from the pdf. 
- *Carefully* poke a hole through the dot in the centre of each wheel.
- Place the smaller circle over the larger circle so that the holes line up, and join them
together using a paperclip.
- The two circles should be able to rotate around this centre hole with respect to each
other.

### What is the Caesar Cipher?

- Essentially a shift
- Plaintext(Regular) alphabet and Cipher(Code) alphabet in alphabetical order
- We'll try an example with a 19 letter shift
- Pull out your wheels! We're ging to try an example.  
![caesar example 1](images/caesar1.PNG)  
- Line up the letter "A" on the inside circle (this represents your plain text alphabet) with the letter "T" on the outside circle (this represents your cipher alphabet.

Now, we have to figure out how to use this key. Let's try and decode this Ceasar Cipher. The answer will be my favorite place to visit.

Start by finding the first letter of the code, "M", on your big circle. Then, write down the letter on the small circle that is lined up with the "M" on your outside circle. To give you a hint, the first letter should be a "T". Now, all you have to do is keep repeating this for each letter of the message and then you will know my favorite place to visit. 

Now, you can try to crack this code on your own. The answer should be a type of cereal.

Feel free to take a break here and practice writing your own codes using your wheel. You can practice writing your name, your school, your favorite ice cream flavor, or anything you want. If you're eager, try to teach a sibling, parent, or friend how to use your wheel to crack Caesar Ciphers and practice writing secret messages to each other!

### How Do You Solve a Caesar Cipher?

In order to use your Caesar wheel to crack codes, you need to know the size of the shift. Most of the time, you don't know the size of the shift. No worries, we can still solve these codes it just takes a little more thinking. Here are some helpful hints on how to crack Ceasar Ciphers.  
- Look for a hint, like...
  - Single letter words (I & A)
  - Likely words you have most of the letters for
  - 2 letter words (in, on, no, of, so, to, etc.)
  - Name or place that you know is in the cipher
- Utilize letter frequency

![letter frequency chart](images/letter_frequency.PNG)  
Remember, once you have 1 letter figured out, you can line it up on your wheel and you now have a key to decipher the whole code.

### Practice!

Now that you've learned about Caesar Ciphers and how to decode them, head to this [link](https://learnification.fun/) for more practice. Log in using any google account you or your parents have. Then click on the menu button in the top left corner, and click on bathroom ciphers. This will take you through a few examples of Caesar Ciphers, but once you get to a problem that asks about a different type of cipher, come back here to learn how to solve it.

### The Substitution Cipher

The Substitution Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, there are just a few slight differences.  
We are going to focus on the Aristocrat cipher here.
